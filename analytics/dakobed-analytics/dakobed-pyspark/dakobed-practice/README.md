Working with date types in Spark..

I was not able make use of the DateType, instead I should be able to work with the dates using imports from 



PySpark classes
        pyspark.sql.SparkSession Main entry point for DataFrame and SQL functionality.
        pyspark.sql.DataFrame A distributed collection of data grouped into named columns.
        pyspark.sql.Column A column expression in a DataFrame.
        pyspark.sql.Row A row of data in a DataFrame.
